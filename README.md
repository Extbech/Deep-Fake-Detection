# Deep-Fake-Detection

- Dataset:

  - The dataset can be found and downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deepfake-detection-challenge/data
  - The code expects it to be put under a folder called /data

- How to run:
  - Download the data and placed it under a /data folder
  - Do "pip install -r reqs.txt" to download the needed packages
  - Run the notebook

- Project rules:

  - The project accounts the 40 % of your grade (working code + written report + presentation).
  - You will get a grade based on the novelty, quality and complexity of the project, along with the ability to show use of appropriate models, preprocessing techniques and evaluation strategies.
  - The projects are done in groups of 2-4.


- These are the list of projects suggested but you are free to choose your own topic as well:
  - Deep fake detection challenge
    - We will use the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview to an external site.
    - Explore different deep neural network architectures
    - Copying existing notebooks will result in disqualification
    - The solution should be using tensorflow APIs or pytorch or any other framework
