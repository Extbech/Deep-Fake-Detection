# Deep-Fake-Detection
- Decide the topic
- Specify the preferences here
- Deadline for registering the project is 20.03.2023 (11.59 pm).
- Register your team in Canvas (group registration)
- Check if know the task clearly,
- Is it supervised? or unsupervised task?
- Pattern detection or anomoly detection?
- Write down the task description, input, expected output, potential challenges you expect
  - if you have the appropriate data for the task
  - Look for multiple datasets preferably
  - if it is supervised task do you have labels?
  - If you want to use deep learning do you have enough data?
- Decide your roles in the project
- Divide tasks team work is important
- Roughly each member should contribute for 1/3rd of the load (or whatever your team size is)
- Cleanup, Explore the data
  - Remove noise if any
  - Check for outliers
  - Normalize, feature scaling, binarize see what is necessary
  - apply SVD or PCA or TSNE to visuzalize
- Decide which data mining algorithm is suitable?
  - Possibly several
  - Try a few algorithms you are free to use sklearn or whatever library you prefer
  - Possibly ensemble techniques like random forest or adaboost work better
  - Possibly a new method, or novel set of features for the same methods
- Experiments
  - paramter tuning
    - Learning rate, regurlarization parameter, dropout etc
    - Depth and width of neural network
    - Model specific parameters for CNNs and RNNS or any other type of neural network you are training
    - For unsupervised techniques cluster size etc
  - compare all the approaches
  - document the limitations of all the approaches you try
  - Choose the best performing method and do more detailed analysis
- evaluation measures
  - Precision, Recall, F1, ROC curve
  - Statistical significance test (see the examples here Links to an external site.)
- Report
  - At least 4 pages (max 10 pages) in 2 column ACM conference style in latex (Here is the link to the template on overleaf Links to an external site.)
  - Writing should be high quality technical writing not copy pasting think of this as a writing practice for your thesis
  - Describe the task, dataset, methods you use and discuss their limitations you saw in the experiments
  - Don't forget to include the github link to your code in the report along with a README.md in github repository which mentions how to reproduce your results in the report.
  - Very important: Document who did what and justify you did equal share of the tasks
- Presentation
  - 5-10 minutes presentation per team
  - Discuss the problem, data, interesting findings etc
  - In person project presentations are preferred. 
- Deadline
  - 26.04.2023
